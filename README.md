# UnyxRF PCB

**UnyxRF** is an open-source PCB designed for the **M5StickC Plus 2**, allowing direct connection of multiple external modules via a **1√ó8 pin header** and a **Grove port**.
The aim of this project is to provide a **compact**, **flexible**, and **easy-to-build** board for RF and storage development.
It is fully compatible with [Bruce](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce), expanding its use cases for open-source projects.

A big thanks to [sleepymorph](https://github.com/sleepymorph) for fixing all schematic issues!
I‚Äôve redesigned the board so it can be **easily soldered at home** without specialized equipment.
The second production batch is currently on order.
