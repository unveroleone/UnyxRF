# UnyxRF PCB

UnyxRF is an open-source PCB designed for the **M5StickC Plus 2**, enabling direct connection of multiple external modules through a 1x8 pin header and a Grove port.  
The goal of this project is to provide a compact and flexible board that integrates key modules for RF and storage development.  
It is also compatible with [Bruce](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce), offering extended use cases for open-source development.
